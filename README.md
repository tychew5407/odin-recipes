# Odin Recipes

A small project to practice HTML to form a mini cookbook. Will demonstrate understanding of setting up an HTML boilerplate; handling links, images and text; managing a file structure to form a website.

Contains three recipes for Simple Macaroni and Cheese, Chicken Makhani (Indian butter chicken), and The Ultimate Brownie.

This project was taken from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes">The Odin Project's Foundations Course</a>.
